### Project Description 
This study aims to investigate the relationship between suicide rates and various proxies of 'Social Capital loss' in the United States from 2000 to 2022. The breakdown of society in the West, marked by rising rates of racism, hate speech, and discrimination, has been accompanied by an increase in suicide rates. 

Given the limited research on this topic, this study seeks to elucidate the correlation and the causal effect between suicide rates and the increase in hate groups and hate crimes, among other factors.


### Research Question

What is the relationship between suicide and ‘social capital loss’ in the United States (2000-2022)?

H0: There is a strong relation between suicide and social capital loss.

H1: There is no strong relation between suicide and social capital loss.

## Definition of 'Social Capital'
Sociology defines 'Social Capital' as the pillars of a "functioning and stable society":
- Employment
- Absence of Crime
- Political Participation
- Economic Equality
- Access to Education

  
## Data

The dataset used in this study consists of various sources to measure the impact of social capital loss on suicide rates. The data includes information on hate groups, hate crimes, unemployment rates, poverty rates, and religious affiliation, alongside suicide rates per 100,000 individuals.

## Data Sources

- Hate Groups: Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), 2022
- Hate Crimes: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), 2022
- Unemployment: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 2022
- Suicide: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2022
- Other variables

Independent Variables:
- Hate Groups
- Hate Crimes
- Unemployment Rate
- Poverty Rate
- Religious Affiliation
- Etc.
  
Dependent Variable:
- Suicides per 100,000 individuals

**Number of observations: 71,392**

## File Structure

- Data File: The cleaned data for the study is available in the file Suicide_Social_Capital_Data.xlsx.
Code Files:
- Map and Spatial Analysis: Contains all code for U.S. map and including ggplot. This code is located in the folder Map_and_Spatial_Analysis.R.
- Panel Regression (Spatial and Fixed Effect): Contains code for causality or regression analysis and is located in the file Panel_Regression_Spatial_and_Fixed_Effect.R.

To ensure the code runs without error, it is recommended to clone the file structure to your local system.

## Methodology
- This study employs fixed-effects estimation of social capital loss on suicide rates across the United States from 2000 to 2022.
- This study also plots all of the suicide rates combined with the number of hate groups in each U.S. country

**Analytical Techniques**
- Panel Data Fixed Effect Regression Analysis: Useful for time-series analyses with large sample sizes and controlling characteristics that do not change drastically over time.
- Pearson Correlation: Used to measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
